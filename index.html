<h2><center>From Voice to Vision: My Journey to Becoming a News Presenter</center></h2>

      <p>Since i was a child, I have always been captivated by the influence of stories and the power of words. Watching news presenter on television by present current events confidently and clarity inspired me to dream of standing in front of camera too and delivering stories that matter. Becoming a news presenter involves more than just reading the news. It also includes connecting facts with feelings and becoming the audience's trusted voice.</p>
